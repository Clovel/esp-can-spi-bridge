Lawicel CANUSB Driver usage under Linux
=======================================

This is a very simple example on how to use the Lawicel AB CANUSB adapter under Linux.
Instructions and the code for the FTDI driver used is included in this document but can
also be retrived from the ftdi site http://www.ftdichip.com/.


Instructions for installing the d2xx shared lib
===============================================

As Linux distributions vary these instructions are a guide to installation and use.
This setup works with Mandrake 9.2 and Redhat/Fedora distributions but may require some 
investigation on other distributions.

This library has been tested using kernel 2.4.25. 
Limited testing on kernel 2.6 has been carried out. Please contact ftdi support with your
issues.

Full D2XX documentation is available for the Windows dll. 

1. As root user copy the following files to /usr/local/lib
cp libftd2xx.so.0.4.10 /usr/local/lib

2. copy libd2xx_table.so to /usr/lib (Not needed from version 0.4.10)
cp libd2xx_table.so /usr/lib

3. Change directory to /usr/local/lib
cd /usr/local/lib

4. make symbolic links to these files using the following commands:
ln -s libftd2xx.so.0.4.10 libftd2xx.so

5. Change directory to /usr/lib
cd /usr/lib

6. make symbolic links to these files using the following commands:
ln -s /usr/local/lib/libftd2xx.so.0.4.10 libftd2xx.so

7. Add the following line to /etc/fstab:

Mandrake
========
none /proc/bus/usb usbdevfs defaults,devmode=0666 0 0

Redhat and Fedora
=================
none /proc/bus/usb usbdevfs defaults,mode=0666 0 0

use "usbfs" instead of "usbdevfs" in 2.6 kernels

Debian, Ubuntu
==============
none /proc/bus/usb   usbfs   defaults,devmode=0666   0 0

use "usbfs" instead of "usbdevfs" in 2.6 kernels

7. Remount all in the fstab file
mount -a

8.) Build the sample with 'make'

9. run the sample 'test_canusb' which will demonstrate how to use the canusb adapter 
through a few simple samples. Remember to do this test as the root user to prevent influence from security settings.


This will work smoothly in most cases. Sometime ther can be minor problems. One common 
problem is that a serial driver already has taken the USB channel. To resolv this
  
1. you must unload this driver (and usbserial) if it is attached to your device 

"rmmod ftdi_sio" 

and 

"rmmod usbserial"

as root user. 

Also check that the adapter is visible to the system with

"cat /proc/bus/usb/devices"

which will give a result with the following form

T:  Bus=02 Lev=01 Prnt=01 Port=00 Cnt=01 Dev#=  2 Spd=12  MxCh= 0
D:  Ver= 2.00 Cls=00(>ifc ) Sub=00 Prot=00 MxPS= 8 #Cfgs=  1
P:  Vendor=0403 ProdID=ffa8 Rev= 4.00
S:  Manufacturer=LAWICEL
S:  Product=CANUSB
S:  SerialNumber=LWO65RKA
C:* #Ifs= 1 Cfg#= 1 Atr=80 MxPwr= 60mA
I:  If#= 0 Alt= 0 #EPs= 2 Cls=ff(vend.) Sub=ff Prot=ff Driver=(none)
E:  Ad=81(I) Atr=02(Bulk) MxPS=  64 Ivl=0ms
E:  Ad=02(O) Atr=02(Bulk) MxPS=  64 Ivl=0ms

if# is the adapter index that is used fo ft_Open

---

On may systems the usb device is only writeable for the root user. You may therefore have to change the permissions for the device in /proc/bus/usb/n where "n" is the listed after "Dev#=" when you do "cat /proc/bus/usb/devices"




Good Luck!
